Unit Testing

In this project, I apply the “Unit Testing” technique to collectively solve a range of challenges that might arise in the course of building up and application of functions in standalone modules.
Unit testing is a testing technique in which individual modules are tested to determine if there are any issues by the developer himself. It is concerned with functional correctness of the standalone modules.

Unit tests are handy and have the potential to:
•	Reduces defects in the newly developed features or reduces bugs when changing the existing functionality.
•	Reduces cost and time of testing as defects are captured in very early phase.
•	Improves design and allows better refactoring of code.
•	 when integrated with build gives the quality of the build as well.


In this project, I apply a couple of methods from the  unittest package to generate  a series of automated tests for the functions I have created in my standalone modules.  For instance, I apply the Mock() and patch methods to create a connection string to a mock data base, on which I will apply the unit tests. Furthermore, as an alternative to the unittest package, I use the pytest package which uses  “assert statements” to authenticate the functionality of my defined functions.

As a result of applying the two above stated packages, I was able to generate a series of unit tests that automatically test the functionality of created functions in standalone modules
